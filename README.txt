Boorudex
~~~~~~~~
Designed for the Overbooru, this SCore based software adds submission queues, categories, and other fun features that make administration easier than whipping out Notepad :)


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MySQL 4.1+
PHP 5.0+


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Create a blank database
2) Unzip SCore into a folder on the web host
3) Visit the folder with a web browser
4) Enter the location of the database
5) Click "install". Hopefully you'll end up at the welcome screen; if
   not, you should be given instructions on how to fix any errors

Licence
~~~~~~~
From the original Shimmie README:
All code is GPLv2 unless mentioned otherwise; ie, if you give SCore to
someone else, you have to give them the source (which should be easy, as PHP
is an interpreted language...). If you want to add customisations to your own
site, then those customisations belong to you, and you can do what you want
with them.
